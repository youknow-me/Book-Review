          effective ways of thinking like affluent individuals. On the whole,

          practical counsel that can steer you in fortifying your finances
          immeasurably. If building wealth and attaining fiscal freedom is what

        <p>
          I completely acknowledge that this book do change the thinking
          patterns of an individual's mind.Though it talks about umpteen topics
          but the greatest thing which I loved most about it is the concept of
          faith in your subconscious mind.Whatever you cherish most in life ,you
          just have to imagine it ,feel it and believe it, wonders happen
          undoubtedly,this is all because the Divine Power of our subconscious
          mind creates attractions and develops unimaginable sources from the
          unknown to make that happen.It is also applicable to the things we
          fear most.i can relate it with an experience.Actually I have phobia
          from lizards🦎.One day I saw two lizards in my kitchen and I firmly
          thought the lizards will die today,and I mentally imagined the lizards
          dying,even though I was not knowing who and how will that happen
          because I myself was very much frightened but I send this message to
          my subconscious mind and in an hours duration my niece sprayed them
          ,and they dropped on the floor dyingly. I send good wishes, positive
          vibes and many blessings to all the people around the globe. Happy
          reading!

        <p>
          Every single person must have financial knowledge. every person can
          become a millianiar whoever he was floor cleaner in petrol pump or
          graduate from most reputed University. Any person can earn money while
          sleeping and any person can be declared bankrupt. It totally up to us.
          showing off your expensive to other means simplest and fastest way to
          poor. Another lesson what author want to teach us is that Be
          optimistic about the future but not paranoid about obstacles to
          success. Handle your money in right way. If you cant take care of 10
          lakhs rupees, how you can manage 10 crore. Take a little bit habbit of
          investing and saving which is best way for growing like Ronald Read.
          Morgan says," you can get rich with small salary but no chance of
          without saving." Best book for finance. Must read for all.

          A Passage to India is in reality, as far as I have come to comprehend
          in lately, going through Internet materials and latest researches, is
          the outcome of his visit to India and the desire to know it India, its
          culture, philosophy, art and society, the unity in diversity and above
          all what it synthesizes in the end with a view to giving an impetus to
          Hindu-Muslim-Christian unity making the things happen in the Marabar
          Caves, which is but the Barabar Caves of the Ajivika sects of the
          Indian heterodox school together with his analysis of gender bias,
          hypocrisy, racial prejudice, communal gap, thinking mind-set and
          feminine repression in directly. If India to the West is a novel
          experience, a delving into Orientalism and myth and mysticism, it is
          also exotic and full of unnecessary hazards. Our orthodox,
          conservative standpoint sometimes hinders, obstructs vehemently in an
          inhuman way the natural flow of world-encompassing, all-inclusive
          humanism.

        <p>
          During the latter half of 2019, I noted that many GR friends were
          reading Muriel Spark. Quite a few reviews of The Prime of Miss Jean
          Brodie popped up on the site. I had seen the movie starring Maggie
          Smith as Jean Brodie and remembered her portrayal well. I decided I
          best read one of her novels as I hadn’t done so to date.

        <p>
          Dr. Attia’s book is written for the medical professional and anyone
          who is seriously looking for substantiated information on how to live
          a healthy and longer life. As someone who has been studying and
          practicing health and longevity for years I found OUTLIVE informative
          and interesting because I’m interested in being able to perform the
          centenarian decathlon. Additionally, as someone who works with medical
          students, I find them being prepared for reactive medicine 2.0 and
          being taught very little knowledge about nutrition and exercise and
          the opportunity to learn how to help their future patients overcome
          disease in the short and longer term by exploring and practicing
          Medicine 3.0. Dr. Attia offers all the science you desire with
          constant reference to experts in various areas of medical science, if
          you are willing to work to learn more about the science. I have found
          inspired people are those who have experienced challenges and found
          ways to overcome them to be the most credible. OUTLIVE is for the
          medical professionals seeking to “up their game” and also the average
          person who can wade through the science and capture the overall
          message that there is a path to a healthier and more active life if
          you are willing to step outside your comfort zone and the seductions
          of modern life. Dr. Attia offers many examples of individuals’ success
          as well as outlining his own ambitious efforts to prepare for a long &
          healthy life.

        <h3>Saisha Chakraborty says...</h3>
        <p>
          This book delves deep into the power of small habits and their ability
          to make a big impact on our lives. It offers practical strategies and
          insightful anecdotes to help readers understand how to build and break
          habits effectively. One significant aspect of this book is the
          author's emphasis on the idea that change does not occur overnight,
          but rather through the accumulation of small, consistent actions. He
          outlines a simple yet powerful framework, the four laws of behavior
          change, consisting of making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and
          satisfying. These laws, when applied properly, can help readers create
          desirable habits and eliminate undesirable ones. The author backs up
          his claims and advice with scientific research and studies, which I
          appreciated. By illustrating the psychology and neuroscience behind
          habit formation, he provides a solid foundation and credibility for
          his suggestions. This evidence-based approach adds weight to the ideas
          presented, making them more compelling and trustworthy. The author's
          writing style is engaging and easy to understand. He uses relatable
          anecdotes and compelling examples to illustrate his points, which kept
          me hooked from the beginning until the end. The book is organized in a
          logical and coherent manner, making it easy to refer back to specific
          chapters or sections when needed. Atomic Habits is a must-read for
          anyone looking to improve their lives by harnessing the power of
          habit. For those who are seeking personal growth, better productivity,
          or healthier habits, this book offers invaluable insights that can
          help you reach your goals.

        <h3>Samantha Kapoor says...</h3>
        <p>
          "The Diary Of A Young Girl" by Anne Frank is not a mere teenage girl's
          diary entry, but is way more deep than that. This book is the personal
          account of the author, Anne Frank, maintained by her during her hiding
          in the 'secret annex' at the time of World War II. It will not be
          right to perceive it as an account of childish rambles and whines, but
          rather it is a wonderful literary piece, depicting the beauty and
          significant potential of the human mind. As you turn through the pages
          of this book, you get to read about the author's opinions, thoughts
          and ideas on various subjects including matters of war, religion,
          philosophy, human relationships and desires etc, which are truly
          fascinating. The readers also get an idea about the instability and
          fragility in a teenager's life which is quite relatable. Anne has an
          interesting personality and perspective towards life and the way she
          keeps an understanding of herself and everyone around her is
          intriguing. She is a courageous young lady who aspires to be a writer
          or a journalist on growing up and dwells on various modern-day ideas.
          It is absolutely enchanting to see how a girl so young has her own
          opinions on great topics such as world politics and how her creativity
          and powerful imagination are beautifully described in her own words.
          The book totally serves as an insightful medium for learning.

        <p>
          A tremendously harrowing read. A bleak, unsparing and relentless look
          into a part of the American psyche that is lost to most people. Decent
          God Fearing country folk living their lives out bump up against small
          time criminals whose aimless lives and disregard of any human civilty
          cannot be fathomed. The bloody acts are not born of rage or anger but
          of spontaneous violence brewing in a competitive cycle between the
          killers.
